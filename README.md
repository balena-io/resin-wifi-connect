# resin-wifi-connect Python example

This repo is a fork of [resin-wifi-connect](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-wifi-connect) that shows how to integrate that tool on a Python project.
This app runs the resin-wifi-connect node application and, after a wifi connection has been established, runs a Hello World python (Flask) server.

The differences between this repo and resin-wifi-connect can be seen in [Dockerfile.template](./Dockerfile.template), the [start](./start) script and the [python-server](./python-server) folder.

## How to use this
This is a [resin.io](http://resin.io) application. Check out our [Getting Started](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/installing/gettingStarted.md) guide if it's your first time using Resin.

This project is meant to be integrated as part of a larger application (that is, _your_ application).

If you need to add dependencies, add the corresponding statements in the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.template) template. You can add the commands that run your app in the [start](./start) script. This app only exits after a successful connection, so if you add your app after [line 3](./start#L3) you ensure that everything happens after wifi is correctly configured.

This is a node.js application, but your app can be any language/framework you want as long as you install it properly - if you need help, check out our [Dockerfile guide](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/using/dockerfile.md). This project uses a Resin feature called "Dockerfile template": the base image is chosen depending on the architecture, specified by the `%%RESIN_ARCH%%` variable (see [line 1](./Dockerfile.template#L1) in the template).

## How it works
This app interacts with the Connman connection manager in Resin's base OS. It checks whether WiFi is connected, tries to join the favorite network, and if this fails, it opens an Access Point to which you can connect using a laptop or mobile phone.

The access point's name (SSID) is, by default, "ResinAP". You can change this by changing the `SSID` [Environment Variable](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/using/env-vars.md). By default, the network is unprotected, but you can add a WPA2 passphrase by setting the `PASSPHRASE` environment variable. Keep in mind that, once you set a passphrase, you can't go back to an unprotected network on an already provisioned device.

When you connect to the access point, any web page you open will be redirected to our captive portal page, where you can select the SSID and passphrase of the WiFi network to connect to. After this, the app will disable the AP and try to connect. If it fails, it will enable the AP for you to try again. If it succeeds, the network will be remembered by Connman as a favorite.
